# Dns-server
This network is maked by using routers, switch and servers. 
In this project our end-user gets IP address, subnet mask and DNS server from local DHCP pool and when end-user writes URL address in web browser, firstly that request goes to DNS server. 
There a server sends a request to IP address of Web server that is appropriate to that URL address. Then, Web server sends information related requested webpage to that end-user.
